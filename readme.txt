Remove Checkout Fields for Woocommerce is simple plugin that lets you hide/remove default woocommerce checkout fields with few clicks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I remove Email field? =

Email field removal option is not included on purpose because email field is used to notify the customers about their order. Moreover, your payment gateway (for example Stripe) will use Email field and show it in dashboard. Still, if you need Email field removal included, you can inform me at wordpress support forum.
